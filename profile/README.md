Homeopathic Medicines for Cough: A Comprehensive Guide

Coughing is a common reflex action that helps clear the airways of irritants, mucus, or foreign particles. While it is often dismissed as a minor inconvenience, chronic or severe coughing can indicate underlying health issues. Homeopathic medicines offer a holistic approach to treating cough by addressing the root cause rather than merely suppressing the symptoms. This article explores the causes, symptoms, effects, prevention, and detailed homeopathic treatments for cough in a structured and comprehensive manner.
